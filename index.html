            <p class="gatekeep-info">Gatekeep is a discord server which has an
                evergrowing list of homestays. You find a homestay you wanna stay at,
                contact & book them yourself. Don't worry!! We only add a homestay after 
                checking their documents thoroughly. Plus most of our homestays are present
                on other major websites as well. All of your other FAQs are answered on 
                our discord server.

            <p>Right now, we're trying to grow in two countries - India and Canada & so it's free to join our

                & <a href="https://discord.gg/vcXNrJpMyP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discord-CA</a> server but after we reach

                buy our membership for a very little amount & then you'll get a

                this list will keep growing longer & longer as we move forwards.
