            <h3 class="what-gatekeep">What is gatekeep for?</h3>
            <p class="gatekeep-info">Gatekeep is a Discord server with an ever-growing list of homestays. 
                You can find a homestay you want to stay at, contact them, and book 
                directly via whatsapp. This helps you avoid paying exorbitant service fees to the third party
                booking apps. Don't worry! We only add a homestay after thoroughly checking 
                their documents and most of our homestays are also listed on other major websites,
                so you can always cross-check.
                If you have anymore questions, ask them directly on our server!

            <h3>How to join Gatekeep community?</h3>
            <p>Right now, it's free to join our 
                <a href="https://discord.gg/AAJWcMnphH" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discord</a> 
                server. You won't find any homestays on our server yet because we've just started
                talking to the homestay owners, & it'll take some time before there is a long list of homestays on
                our server. But in the meantime, you can join the server and chill with others. 
                <br>When we start adding homestays,
                you will only find homestays from India initially, but we plan to expand to other countries over time. 
                However, once we reach critical mass, new users will need to subscribe to our 
                <a href="https://patreon.com/Gatekeep" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patreon</a> for a small fee to 
                receive a link to our Discord server. Although it is optional, your support through Patreon will still mean a lot.
